# w266_project

## Milestone
### Draft/Outline must be submitted by 3/18 (Might Just be Mark's Optional. When does your section need it?)


## Project Goal
### Improve binary classification on the Cloze Story dataset which consists of a brief, one-paragraph story with two possible outcomes, a correct and an incorrect one.

## Models
### 1) Pre-trained models:
###    a. T5
###    b. Bert
### 2) Standalone models (models enhanced with self-attention layers and without pre-training)
###    a. LSTM
###    b. CNN
###    c. Transformers

## Algorithms
### 1) Transformer architecture with self-attention layers
### 2) OPT Model for Knowledge Generation on Story Prompts, then second LLM for making predictions using the knowledge statements
### 3) Weighted Pathfinding or Minimum Spanning Tree for creating relevant subgraphs, then pass it through an MH-GRN or QA-GNN model
